Introduction

Origin of the research problem: 

The use of social media users are growing exponentially. According to social statistics one third of the world’s population is already engaged with social media and on an average 10% of the population, to use social media sites, is increasing every year. 

There is no clear definition of social media addiction but it is obvious that it indicates over usage of internet facility to be a part of virtual groups or person. It is addictive and has resulted in lot of psychological problems like anxiety, depression etc. Immediate response syndrome is clearly visible among users which are the state of checking our social media sites again and again which may lead to psychological imbalance.

Adolescents are the most affected group of this usage. This is the time where they should be career oriented, exploring newer avenues in their life, but very surprisingly most of the constructive time is simply wasted in uploading and maintaining relationship which may not have any significant impact in their development. So the researcher was keen to understand the psyche behind these activities, does it have any relationship with their respective self esteem?

According to Oxford’s university, Self-esteem reflects an individual's overall subjective emotional evaluation of his or her own worth. It is the decision made by an individual as an attitude towards the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself, (for example, &quot;I am competent&quot;, &quot;I am worthy&quot;), as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. 

Students self esteem may play a dual role in addiction towards social media. High Self esteem may result to more interaction and showcasing oneself in social platforms. On the other hand sometimes low self esteem may also lead to better participation in virtual world because they hesitate to be a part of the real world.  The researcher is keen to know whether there is positive/ negative or no relationship between social addiction and self esteem of students.










Need of the Study:
Internet de-addiction has become the need of the hour because the negative impact of internet addiction is superseding the positive impact. Following are the few cons which the researcher was able to identify:
Phubbing: Phubbing is the practice of ignoring one's companion or companions in order to pay attention to one's phone or other mobile device. This is a new word added to the dictionary because of the traits seen in people who overuses mobile devices. So the use of technology instead of making our life easier has in fact created a barrier between humans only.
Breakdown of real communication: If the addiction of internet is very large then the person tries to spend most of their time in virtual communication. This breaks the interest of having real communication. 
Immediate response syndrome/ instant need of immediate gratification: Once a message is sent or picture is posted, have you realized how many times you look back into your mobile to check the trailing messages or how many likes you have got or even how many social friends have even gone through it?
Inability to focus on the present: Adolescents are so busy sharing whatever they do that they have lost to live in the moment for the sake of sharing the moment.
Sleep deprivation: Internet has opened up such vast avenues for the young generation that they are totally absorbed in variety of internet related activities. It is to such an extent that they cannot balance their life compromising upon their sleep habits. Sleep deprivation is further leading to restlessness, anxiety and other health related issues.
Lack of hobby: Gone are the days when young generation would collect rare historical objects as their hobby, go out for nature trails, distress them by engaging in games and sports 
Attention span / Memory loss: We have become slaves in the hand of technology. It has overpowered our capabilities to such an extent that we have lost believing in our memory. We have become so dependent on technology that for every small thing instead of using our brains we click to find out information. 
Lack of language comprehension: Too many short forms used in messages have resulted in lack of incorrect usage of language. 
Health related issues: It has resulted in the rise of 'neurasthenia' ('tired nerves') because of overuse of mobile devices.





Review of related literature:
Kanoh, Hiroko (2016) analyzed trends of social media and self-esteem by the Rosenberg Scale. The spread of SNS has changed communications between people to a great extent. For them it is a place their hearts can rely on and where they can hang out, a place for self-approval, for self-expression and a place where the other person listens to their dissatisfaction and discontent. At the beginning people are interested in knowing what everyone is doing, so they check SNS every day. However, they feel gradually tired. Immediate response syndrome refers to the feeling of having to check SNS sites and being is a state of psychological imbalance. Some have a loss of self-esteem in the SNS communication. So the researcher  analyzed the relationship of social media use and the self-esteem. As results, the high self-efficacy group prefers both Facebook and LINE while the low self-efficacy group tends to use Twitter.


Kircaburun, Kagan (2016) studied Self-Esteem, Daily Internet Use and Social Media Addiction as Predictors of Depression among Turkish Adolescents. In this study, direct and indirect effects of self-esteem, daily internet use and social media addiction to depression levels of adolescents have been investigated by testing a model. This descriptive study was conducted with 1130 students aged between 12 and 18 who are enrolled at different schools in southern region of Aegean. In order to collect data, &quot;Children's Depression Inventory&quot;, &quot;Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale&quot; and &quot;Social Media Addiction Scale&quot; have been used. In order to test the hypotheses Pearson's correlation and structural equation modeling were performed. The findings revealed that self-esteem and social media addiction predict 20% of the daily internet use. Furthermore, while depression was associated with self-esteem and daily internet use directly, social media addiction was affecting depression indirectly. Tested model was able to predict 28% of the depression among adolescents.

Tas, Ibrahim (2017) examined the relationship of Internet addiction and gaming addiction with school engagement and effects of Internet addiction and gaming addiction on school engagement. The research was conducted with 365 students (140, 38.4%, males; 225, 61.6%, females) studying at an Anatolian high school in Gaziantep province. Personal Information Form, Scale of Internet Usage Addiction, Gaming Addiction Scale for Adolescents and School Engagement Scale for Children and Adolescents (High School Form) were utilized as data collection tools. The data obtained were analyzed with correlation and multiple regression analysis. A weak negative relationship was found between Internet addiction and school engagement. No relationship was found between gaming addiction and school engagement. It was also concluded that Internet addiction is a significant predictor of school engagement and gaming addiction does not predict school engagement significantly.






Title of the study: A Study of correlation of Social Media Addiction and Self Esteem 
among Secondary School Students


Objectives:
To find out correlation between social media addiction and self esteem among secondary school students

Hypothesis:
There is no relationship between social media addiction and self esteem among secondary school students

Methodology &amp; Plan of Work: 
The present study is descriptive survey method which deals with description, analysis and interpretation of existing phenomenon. 
The sample for the study is 100 secondary school students of greater Mumbai. 
Tools: 
Rosenberg Social Media Addiction Scale
Self esteem Scale
Findings:
TABLE 1
Relevant Statistics of the Relationship of Social Media Addiction and Self esteem
Variables	Pearson Correlation	Significant
Social media addiction	-0.1	Not significant
Self Esteem		

Interpretation and Discussion:
The correlation value is -0.1 which is not significant. This indicates that self esteem does not play a significant role in social media addiction. 
Students with high self esteem wants to be connected with the world because they want to share their confidence, happiness with the outer world. High self esteem students loves experimenting which may increase the use of social media because they want to explore new things every day. So this enhanced initiative may be a cause of getting addicted to social media more and more. 
On the other hand even if the students have low self esteem, they hesitate to communicate in real world. They may lack self confidence, be in their own shell, and do not confront with real people and real incidences. These are the set of students who then want to go to their comfort zone and engage themselves in virtual media.
Significance of the study:
The study will be significant for the following members of the society:

Students: It will be an eye opener to those students who just waste their time, energy and resources to such a virtual world which does not have any significant impact in their future. Getting addicted to social media have negative impact on health and wellbeing. 

Teacher: Teacher will realize that their roles are now not limited to only teaching learning process; they are guide and counselors to students. They need to engage in more and more constructive activities which will make the students realize the importance of living life with a purpose instead of just getting carried away with addiction.

Parents: Social media addiction leads to many psychological problems too like anxiety, depression, loneliness, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and addiction. It has also led to phubbing i.e. snub contact with social life. So as parents it’s important to first identify whether the child is addicted, and if so how to help the child to come out of this.

Curriculum Framers: Textbooks should include theme based lessons on negative impact of addiction of social media sites, how to balance our self esteem with our day to day dealings etc

Conclusion: 

The social media sites  is highlighting only the best day, the best vacation the best party, the best dress and so on and so forth. The real life has lot more than this but feeds from peers and other social friends reflects only the good part of it. If the child/ student are not matured it may cause distress because they will be unable to relate it with their practical life. 

So we conclude that students, whether they have high self esteem or low self esteem, are simply getting dragged to a darker world. The idea is not abstinence but have better control. In the connected world we live in, it is simply not feasible to prohibit someone from accessing all smart devices. But it has become a necessity to have proper check points to monitor their internet usage.




Baby steps to a digital detox:
We have to accept the fact that internet addiction has become a menace in today’s generation millennial. The reason we keep checking our social media is to keep up with everyone and pace with the ongoing trends. We tend to compare our real lives with others social media life. We need to realize that the entire feed portrayed by a person is a mere highlight of their lives and not their lives as a whole. It is filtered. It is unfair for our own selves to have this habit, we realize that the feeling of missing out (FOMO) while we see others pictures is just an illusion it will help us to get over constantly checking our social media pages. So to combat all these problems, following are few baby steps to a digital detox :

1)	Turn off notifications: The continuous pings in the mobile distract us to do any productive work. It is really hard to resist the siren as we always think it is always important. Therefore turn off notifications of some apps which are not very useful.

2)	Assign time limits for social media sites: It is tough to completely delete social media at once, it is better to have specific time allotted. This means you can keep track of the hours you spent on social media, this also means you wouldn’t constantly be checking your phones.

3)	Choose your friends and followers: Although socializing is good, sometimes it gets out of hand with more friends and followers and it can be pretty time consuming. 

4)	Replace social media time with outdoor activities: You can take your mind off social media by substituting that time by pursuing your hobbies or developing new ones.

5)	Do not take your electronics to bed: Your bedroom should be a place of peace and tranquility. Reflect the activities which you have witnessed throughout the day and plan for tomorrow instead of hanging on social media sites or other electronics. The continuous signals sent by Wi-Fi disturb our mental being too.

6)	Uninstall Social Media: This will eliminate the chance of getting distracted completely. 

7)	Look at the positive benefits of social media detox: Our brain is inclined to do activities which have reasoned to it. If you look at the benefits of the detox , we can have more focused life, better mental health, strong relationships  and so on and so forth.

According to social statistics one third of the world’s population is already engaged with social media and on an average 10% of the population, to use social media sites, is increasing every year. <br><br>There is no clear definition of social media addiction but it is obvious that it indicates over usage of internet facility to be a part of virtual groups or person. It is addictive and has resulted in lot of psychological problems like anxiety, depression etc. Immediate response syndrome is clearly visible among users which are the state of checking our social media sites again and again which may lead to psychological imbalance.<br><br>Adolescents are the most affected group of this usage. This is the time where they should be career oriented, exploring newer avenues in their life, but very surprisingly most of the constructive time is simply wasted in uploading and maintaining relationship which may not have any significant impact in their development. So the researcher was keen to understand the psyche behind these activities, does it have any relationship with their respective self esteem?<br><br>According to Oxford’s university, Self-esteem reflects an individual's overall subjective emotional evaluation of his or her own worth. It is the decision made by an individual as an attitude towards the self. Self-esteem encompasses beliefs about oneself, (for example, "I am competent", "I am worthy"), as well as emotional states, such as triumph, despair, pride, and shame. <br><br>Students self esteem may play a dual role in addiction towards social media. High Self esteem may result to more interaction and showcasing oneself in social platforms. On the other hand sometimes low self esteem may also lead to better participation in virtual world because they hesitate to be a part of the real world.  The researcher is keen to know whether there is positive/ negative or no relationship between social addiction and self esteem of students.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Need of the Study:<br>Internet de-addiction has become the need of the hour because the negative impact of internet addiction is superseding the positive impact. Following are the few cons which the researcher was able to identify:<br>Phubbing: Phubbing is the practice of ignoring one's companion or companions in order to pay attention to one's phone or other mobile device. This is a new word added to the dictionary because of the traits seen in people who overuses mobile devices. So the use of technology instead of making our life easier has in fact created a barrier between humans only.<br>Breakdown of real communication: If the addiction of internet is very large then the person tries to spend most of their time in virtual communication. This breaks the interest of having real communication. <br>Immediate response syndrome/ instant need of immediate gratification: Once a message is sent or picture is posted, have you realized how many times you look back into your mobile to check the trailing messages or how many likes you have got or even how many social friends have even gone through it?<br>Inability to focus on the present: Adolescents are so busy sharing whatever they do that they have lost to live in the moment for the sake of sharing the moment.<br>Sleep deprivation: Internet has opened up such vast avenues for the young generation that they are totally absorbed in variety of internet related activities. It is to such an extent that they cannot balance their life compromising upon their sleep habits. Sleep deprivation is further leading to restlessness, anxiety and other health related issues.<br>Lack of hobby: Gone are the days when young generation would collect rare historical objects as their hobby, go out for nature trails, distress them by engaging in games and sports <br>Attention span / Memory loss: We have become slaves in the hand of technology. It has overpowered our capabilities to such an extent that we have lost believing in our memory. We have become so dependent on technology that for every small thing instead of using our brains we click to find out information. <br>Lack of language comprehension: Too many short forms used in messages have resulted in lack of incorrect usage of language. <br>Health related issues: It has resulted in the rise of 'neurasthenia' ('tired nerves') because of overuse of mobile devices.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Review of related literature:<br>Kanoh, Hiroko (2016) analyzed trends of social media and self-esteem by the Rosenberg Scale. The spread of SNS has changed communications between people to a great extent. For them it is a place their hearts can rely on and where they can hang out, a place for self-approval, for self-expression and a place where the other person listens to their dissatisfaction and discontent. At the beginning people are interested in knowing what everyone is doing, so they check SNS every day. However, they feel gradually tired. Immediate response syndrome refers to the feeling of having to check SNS sites and being is a state of psychological imbalance. Some have a loss of self-esteem in the SNS communication. So the researcher  analyzed the relationship of social media use and the self-esteem. As results, the high self-efficacy group prefers both Facebook and LINE while the low self-efficacy group tends to use Twitter.<br><br><br>Kircaburun, Kagan (2016) studied Self-Esteem, Daily Internet Use and Social Media Addiction as Predictors of Depression among Turkish Adolescents. In this study, direct and indirect effects of self-esteem, daily internet use and social media addiction to depression levels of adolescents have been investigated by testing a model. This descriptive study was conducted with 1130 students aged between 12 and 18 who are enrolled at different schools in southern region of Aegean. In order to collect data, "Children's Depression Inventory", "Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale" and "Social Media Addiction Scale" have been used. In order to test the hypotheses Pearson's correlation and structural equation modeling were performed. The findings revealed that self-esteem and social media addiction predict 20% of the daily internet use. Furthermore, while depression was associated with self-esteem and daily internet use directly, social media addiction was affecting depression indirectly. Tested model was able to predict 28% of the depression among adolescents.<br><br>Tas, Ibrahim (2017) examined the relationship of Internet addiction and gaming addiction with school engagement and effects of Internet addiction and gaming addiction on school engagement. The research was conducted with 365 students (140, 38.4%, males; 225, 61.6%, females) studying at an Anatolian high school in Gaziantep province. Personal Information Form, Scale of Internet Usage Addiction, Gaming Addiction Scale for Adolescents and School Engagement Scale for Children and Adolescents (High School Form) were utilized as data collection tools. The data obtained were analyzed with correlation and multiple regression analysis. A weak negative relationship was found between Internet addiction and school engagement. No relationship was found between gaming addiction and school engagement. It was also concluded that Internet addiction is a significant predictor of school engagement and gaming addiction does not predict school engagement significantly.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Title of the study: A Study of correlation of Social Media Addiction and Self Esteem <br>among Secondary School Students<br><br><br>Objectives:<br>To find out correlation between social media addiction and self esteem among secondary school students<br><br>Hypothesis:<br>There is no relationship between social media addiction and self esteem among secondary school students<br><br>Methodology &amp; Plan of Work: <br>The present study is descriptive survey method which deals with description, analysis and interpretation of existing phenomenon. <br>The sample for the study is 100 secondary school students of greater Mumbai. <br>Tools: <br>Rosenberg Social Media Addiction Scale<br>Self esteem Scale<br>Findings:<br>TABLE 1<br>Relevant Statistics of the Relationship of Social Media Addiction and Self esteem<br>Variables	Pearson Correlation	Significant<br>Social media addiction	-0.1	Not significant<br>Self Esteem		<br><br>Interpretation and Discussion:<br>The correlation value is -0.1 which is not significant. This indicates that self esteem does not play a significant role in social media addiction. <br>Students with high self esteem wants to be connected with the world because they want to share their confidence, happiness with the outer world. High self esteem students loves experimenting which may increase the use of social media because they want to explore new things every day. So this enhanced initiative may be a cause of getting addicted to social media more and more. <br>On the other hand even if the students have low self esteem, they hesitate to communicate in real world. They may lack self confidence, be in their own shell, and do not confront with real people and real incidences. These are the set of students who then want to go to their comfort zone and engage themselves in virtual media.<br>Significance of the study:<br>The study will be significant for the following members of the society:<br><br>Students: It will be an eye opener to those students who just waste their time, energy and resources to such a virtual world which does not have any significant impact in their future. Getting addicted to social media have negative impact on health and wellbeing. <br><br>Teacher: Teacher will realize that their roles are now not limited to only teaching learning process; they are guide and counselors to students. They need to engage in more and more constructive activities which will make the students realize the importance of living life with a purpose instead of just getting carried away with addiction.<br><br>Parents: Social media addiction leads to many psychological problems too like anxiety, depression, loneliness, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and addiction. It has also led to phubbing i.e. snub contact with social life. So as parents it’s important to first identify whether the child is addicted, and if so how to help the child to come out of this.<br><br>Curriculum Framers: Textbooks should include theme based lessons on negative impact of addiction of social media sites, how to balance our self esteem with our day to day dealings etc<br><br>Conclusion: <br><br>The social media sites  is highlighting only the best day, the best vacation the best party, the best dress and so on and so forth. The real life has lot more than this but feeds from peers and other social friends reflects only the good part of it. If the child/ student are not matured it may cause distress because they will be unable to relate it with their practical life. <br><br>So we conclude that students, whether they have high self esteem or low self esteem, are simply getting dragged to a darker world. The idea is not abstinence but have better control. In the connected world we live in, it is simply not feasible to prohibit someone from accessing all smart devices. But it has become a necessity to have proper check points to monitor their internet usage.<br><br><br><br><br>Baby steps to a digital detox:<br>We have to accept the fact that internet addiction has become a menace in today’s generation millennial. The reason we keep checking our social media is to keep up with everyone and pace with the ongoing trends. We tend to compare our real lives with others social media life. We need to realize that the entire feed portrayed by a person is a mere highlight of their lives and not their lives as a whole. It is filtered. It is unfair for our own selves to have this habit, we realize that the feeling of missing out (FOMO) while we see others pictures is just an illusion it will help us to get over constantly checking our social media pages. So to combat all these problems, following are few baby steps to a digital detox :<br><br>1)	Turn off notifications: The continuous pings in the mobile distract us to do any productive work. It is really hard to resist the siren as we always think it is always important. Therefore turn off notifications of some apps which are not very useful.<br><br>2)	Assign time limits for social media sites: It is tough to completely delete social media at once, it is better to have specific time allotted. This means you can keep track of the hours you spent on social media, this also means you wouldn’t constantly be checking your phones.<br><br>3)	Choose your friends and followers: Although socializing is good, sometimes it gets out of hand with more friends and followers and it can be pretty time consuming. <br><br>4)	Replace social media time with outdoor activities: You can take your mind off social media by substituting that time by pursuing your hobbies or developing new ones.<br><br>5)	Do not take your electronics to bed: Your bedroom should be a place of peace and tranquility. Reflect the activities which you have witnessed throughout the day and plan for tomorrow instead of hanging on social media sites or other electronics. The continuous signals sent by Wi-Fi disturb our mental being too.<br><br>6)	Uninstall Social Media: This will eliminate the chance of getting distracted completely. <br><br>7)	Look at the positive benefits of social media detox: Our brain is inclined to do activities which have reasoned to it. If you look at the benefits of the detox , we can have more focused life, better mental health, strong relationships  and so on and so forth.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>References<br>Kircaburun, Kagan(2016) Self-Esteem, Daily Internet Use and Social Media Addiction as Predictors of Depression among Turkish Adolescents.

      <p>Bhakti Gala's comment<br>I am a class teacher of 8th grade and i am also facing the same problem, but i feel that parents these days are so busy that they don't have enough time to spend with their children and hence buy them expensive gifts in the form of tabs, phone, etc. Children hence, don't go down to play, they don't socialise publicly and prefer the virtual world more. <br>Thus I feel that parents must be counseled more than the child. Parents need to be told the importance of spending time with their children. <br>these days the parents themselves are over active on social media and chose this forum to contact with their children and to find out about them.<br>Things we as teachers can do- <br>Guide parents and let them know the importance of spending time with children. spending at least 45-60 minutes together as a family works well for all.<br>During this time phones, tabs should be put a side.<br>When with family one should turn off notifications.<br>Minimize the usage of internet on the phones.<br>We as teachers can take up role plays, dramas, stating the ill effects of usage.<br>We can have talk by people who have seen/faced the adverse effects and come back to normal.<br>Activities for reducing anxiety, depression, stress should be taken up in the school. Parents also should be kept in a loop always.<br>Students must be given enough opportunities to display their skills, talents so that they do not use social media as a platform to display the same.<br><br>To sum up I would like to say, teachers, parents and students should work together to help each other, as together we can achieve the most and eradicate addiction towards social media.</p>

      <p>I am the class teacher of class X A  and i am also facing similar problems of social media addiction and which lead to serious self esteem issues. One of the girls in my who is a usually a bright student tried to cut the wrist as someone commented on one of her facebook  pictures as " UGLY DUCKLING". <br><br>Gone are the days when people are happy without stimulation from social media and are more than happy. Now is the era of " SOCIAL APPRAISAL " and count by not real friends but virtual friends.  We are not dealing as teachers here conventionally that wil add more hues and cry to the problem rather than solving it. This problem is increasing in an alarming rate and spreading like fire at an accelerating rate and are creating more issues than terrorism and kashmir issue<br><br><br>I as a class teacher is merging with the job of guidance counselor i feel that proper counseling should be given to build rapport with students. Different therapies like Mindfulness workshop which teaches the students to calm their mind should be introduced to schools. <br><br>Simple relaxation techniques with good and calm music should be used by teachers daily to give students a sense of calmness and to interact with themselves to get a clear views about themselves and spend with themselves<br><br>parents and teachers should be trained in how to cater to the basic problems of Internet addiction without getting angry over  children and should go into the depth of basic techniques to be open with children and act rationally at the hour of their needs<br><br>Techniques like progressive relaxation tecniques and recently emerged gadget detox or internet detox act wonderfully with children as the idea is not to get angry and treat them as commodities<br><br>There should be certain boundaries and timelimit to use internet and spend with family and friends <br><br>The Teachers should be trained in various tecniques to train children to take their time away from internet and tell their life is real and God"s gift and no one can hurt their self respect and one comment doesnot change their abilities and potentialities and should engage them in defence activites and craft, poetry reading to realise their true potential so that they can contribute as the cornerstone of Nation and should help them to use positive self talk and tokens of self appreciation using REBT, BT, NLP, TA to help them to realise their importance and self respect and should prevent them from doing self harm and also to make others realise preciousness of eachothers using group therapy including students, teachers, parents.</p>

      <p>I am a teacher of class 9th std.<br>My opinion and guidance for such problems are:-<br>1. Parents can ask their teen to show them how they use social media and what it is  and try to navigate the social world together, rather than acting as a supervisor which help the parent to stop students moving in a wrong path.<br>2. Together with your teen visit their social media channels. Take a look at what your teen is posting online. Check out their favorites and which YouTube channels they are subscribed to. Favorites and subscriptions can give you clues about what they’re watching on the site.<br>3. Educate your teen about their digital reputation. Whenever your teen visits a website, shares content, posts something on a blog or uploads information, they’re adding to their digital footprint. And this is the starting point of getting addicted.<br>4. In order to remove social media addiction from your children  try to spend a quality time with them so that they are engage.<br>5. Make your student aware about the negative and the problem that you can face due to extensive use of social media.</p>

      <p>I am teacher of class 9. <br>I usually observe the students talking about social networking sites, likes and posts.  Everyone wants to be appreciated the way they are and for that they need a platform where they can express themselves the way they want. Students find social networking site is a best platform to express their views, personality and their lifestyle. But someway the other they are getting too much into this. They can’t even live without their mobile phones and they are ready to do anything in urge of getting famous on social networking sites. Because of this many cybercrimes are taking place. To avoid this we can do following things:-<br>1. Teacher should provide opportunity to each student in different competitions instead of those students who are able to win.<br>2. Try to make students aware of the different kind of cybercrimes due to these social networking sites.<br>3. Parents should give more time to their children so that they don’t need someone else to share their problems and good deeds and parents should develop friendly relation with their child.<br>4. Try to involve students in many different activity so that they will be busy in that and won’t get  time to use social networking sites because when a person feels alone and depressed they get into the social sites to entertain themselves.<br>5. Students should try to develop their social skills and also try to involve themselves in different type of completions where they can show their capability and ability.</p>

      <p>I am the class teacher of standard 11th I am also facing the same kind of problem therefore I would like to suggest this guidence<br>In just over 40 years, social media has become a global phenomenon. Social media are websites or applications that allow people to share their ideas, thoughts and feelings through mediums like photos, music and videos. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Ask.fm are just a few examples of such platforms. Social media has made the world a smaller place with just a click of a few buttons. One could literally do anything, such as, posting photos, making videos or exchanging ideas. Furthermore, through social media, one can also readily share ideas and easily communicate with people around the globe. With the convenience and accessibility it brings<br>During their years of formation, children are especially impressionable, and they take in all the information around them like sponges, which makes them an easy target. Social media websites are created to play on human emotions, and one of the biggest buttons they push is the fear of missing out. No human being wants to feel isolated from the rest of the society, and social networking websites make sure that this doesn't happen. They create an illusion of being constantly present and acknowledged by the peers, thus making a person feel safe and adequate.<br><br>A lot of children and teenagers suffer from self-esteem issues, thus looking into social media for approval and attention. It's especially relevant in situations when children don't receive enough support and communication from their parents or offline friends. The article “Why Social Media Is So Addictive” by Tom Lowery provides the information that over 80 % of posts on the social networking websites are about the poster. In such a way, these types of websites are the great sources of social validation for children and adults. However, it is a vicious circle because online interactions are usually quite superficial, and they drive a child even further away from the people in their real lives.<br><br>In these situations, it's much easier to deal with the issues at early stages than when your children cannot imagine their lives without Facebook or other social media websites. Teentor, the extensive cell phone spy software, is highly recommended to all parents who want to protect their kids from any social media harm. The software allows you to monitor and restrict the activity of your child when it comes to any social media websites.<br>Guidance as a teacher to overcome such problems:<br><br> We should tell them more positive impact of social media such as using it for educational purpose.<br><br>We should bring  more activities and discussion in the cclassroom to make them more aware about the negativeeffects n how to deal them.</p>

Now a day interaction with there own parents ,family members and friends as be reduced , concentration in studies  as been reduced to such a extent only because of there addiction towards social media .<br>Using short cut in their language due to which their writing habits has become poor . They are only interested constantly in posting pictures videos and posting their  status in social media  by  not knowing that this is  not going to help any where in their life .They are simply wasting their  valuable time and energy in their precious life . So As a teacher i would like to give some guidance to overcome addiction of social media and  Self Esteem  among the students of junior college .<br><br>following are the principle and guidance : <br>   1)  Regular counselling as to be given to the student to overcome the problem.<br><br>    2)  Engage students more in outdoor Games and cultural activity .<br><br>    3)  strictly prohibit the usage of cell phone during the lecture.<br><br>    4) Teach them what  are the health problem , psychological problem , depression  which is caused due to addiction of <br>      social media .</p>

      <p>I am class teacher of 9th grade.<br>i often face such problems during my lecture. My guidance for such issues which take place during the lectures are,<br> In today's  technosavy world, students are fully engrossed in the social media. Students are more concern about posting their daily activities like shopping, eating , reading books, playing and even their own photos just to get the attraction from others. Even for doing any kind of assignment work the don't have patience to think over it instead they google it and get their information without any effort. During the lecture they keep checking their messages and it result in lack of attention during the lecture. So to overcome such problem , I would suggest that the there should be a separate time allot for such activities like P.T. period. The school should conduct workshop on addiction to social media to guide the students to overcome from the addiction. Often more introvert student who try to be away from the really world may be more active in the social media to grab attention. To overcome such issue teacher should make their lecture more of activity based, so that the students my fully involve in the learning process. And one more very common problem I face is that the  student fall asleep during the lecture and the reasion behind it is the previous night the students were busy in the social media and they feel drowsy during the lecture.</p>
